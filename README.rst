Array storage benchmark
---------------------------------------

Compare the storage speed, retrieval speed and file size for various methods of storing 2D numpy arrays.

Hardware etc
---------------------------------------

The results here are obtained on a normal desktop PC that's several years old and running Ubuntu and has a SSD for storage. You can easily run the benchmarks on your own PC to get more relevant results. You can also apply it to your own data.

* ^ Two checks if it's small for dense data, three checks if also for sparse. All gzipped results are small for sparse data.
* % E.g. easily supports 3D or higher arrays, unequal columns, inhomogeneous type columns...
* ~ Also tested with gzip, stats refer to non-gzipped. Gzipped is always much slower to write, a bit slower to read, for text formats it's at least 50% smaller.
* + Rating refers to using a semi-popular package (probably scipy), as opposed to only python and numpy.
* ++ Very easy (☒☒☒) with an unpopular and/or dedicated package, but the rating refers to only python and numpy.

You can install all dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.pip`. csv and NPY were done with `numpy`_; json and compact json (JsonTricks) were done with `pyjson_tricks`_; png was done with `imgarray`_; fortran unformatted and matlab were done with `scipy`_; pickle, base64 and gzipping were done with python built-ins. HDF5 uses `h5py` (not finished, see issue4_). MessagePack uses `msgpack-numpy`. Seaborn is needed for plotting. You can install all dependencies using `pip install requirements.pip`
